# Arduboy Genius (Simon) Clone

**Description** 

This a simple Simon (or Genius in Brazil) clone that was created as a last project to a Kids Arduboy Programming Course. It's a simple game, but it tries to  mix various subjects learned throught the classes.

**Instructions**

The interface is in portuguese, but the game mimics the Simon mechanics, picking a random color every turn and waiting for the player input. 

The controls are:

UP - Green

RIGHT- Yellow

DOWN - Blue

LEFT - Red



I hope you guys enjoy this little contribuition to the Arduboy community, a place full of great people ready to teach and help everyone!
