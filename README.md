# Arduboy Genius (Simon) Clone

This a simple Simon (or Genius in Brazil) clone that was created as a last project to a Kids Arduboy Programming Course. It's a simple game, but it tries to  mix various subjects learned throught the classes.

I hope you guys enjoy this little contribuition to the Arduboy community, a place full of great people ready to teach and help everyone!
